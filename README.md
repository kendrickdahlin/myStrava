Hi! Welcome to my personal spin on features of the Strava app. This Next.js project allows you view interval style workouts with a more comprehensive view. More features to be developed :)

How to use: Since the app is not public to Strava users, you must log in with Strava API keys instead of Strava login credentials. Upon opening the app, it will prompt for API keys. These can be generated here: https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/#introduction
